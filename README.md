Body Measurement for Tailoring

# **Body Measurement App for Tailoring**

A Flutter-based mobile app that allows users to take photos in specific poses, processes the images on a backend server using advanced machine learning models, and provides accurate body measurements for custom tailoring. The app ensures a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience.

---

## **Features**
- **Photo Capture**: Guides users to capture images in specific poses for accurate measurements.  
- **Server-side Processing**: Images are uploaded to a secure backend for processing using advanced ML models.  
- **Measurement Extraction**: Fetches and calculates key body measurements such as:  
  - Shoulder Width  
  - Chest Circumference  
  - Waist Circumference  
  - Sleeve lenght  
  - Outseam Length (for pants)  
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Displays measurement results in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## **Tech Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: Flutter (Dart)  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `camera` (for capturing images)  
  - `image_picker` (optional for gallery access)  
  - `http` (for API calls to the backend)  

### **Backend**
- **Framework**: Flask
- **Image Processing**: MediaPipe, OpenCV, Human Outline Detection
- **Database**: (Optional) PostgreSQL for logging or tailor integration.

## **Project Setup**

### **1. Prerequisites**
- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)  
- Backend server setup with the mediapipe and openCV ML models.  
- Device with a working camera.  

### **2. Installation**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joshsoftware/hackathon-team-1.git
   cd body-measurement-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Run the app:  
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### **3. Backend Setup**
- Ensure your backend is up and running to process the images.  
- Use the provided API endpoint to connect the app with the backend.

## **How It Works**

### **User Flow**
1. **Capture Photos**: Users are guided to take photos in specific poses.  
2. **Upload to Server**: Captured images are securely uploaded to the backend.  
3. **Image Processing**: The backend processes images using ML models to detect keypoints and calculate measurements.  
4. **Retrieve Results**: The app fetches the measurements and displays them in a user-friendly format.  

### **Key Measurements**
- **Shoulder Width**: Distance between shoulder keypoints.  
- **Chest/Bust Circumference**: Estimated from chest and back keypoints.  
- **Waist Circumference**: Calculated from the narrowest torso keypoints.  
- **Shirt Length**: Shirt Length  
- **Arm Length**: Length between shoulder and wrist point
- **Outseam Length**: Length of Leg

## **To-Do**
- [ ] Add AR-based guidelines for pose correction.
- [ ] Add more measurements eg bicep, neck measurements, etc
- [ ] Enhance measurement accuracy with depth data from LiDAR (for supported devices).  
- [ ] Integrate tailor APIs for seamless measurement sharing.  
- [ ] Add multi-language support for global users.
